Implement a movie booking functionality for this  website where users can book movie tickets, select seats, and complete the payment process seamlessly. The implementation should ensure real-time seat availability updates to prevent booking conflicts.
User Flow:
Movie Selection:
On the movies.jsp page, users click the "Book Now" button for a specific movie, navigating them to the movie booking page.
Booking Details Entry:
On the movie booking page:
Users input:
Booking date
Number of tickets
Show time (Options: 8:30 AM–10:30 AM, 12:30 PM–2:30 PM, 4:30 PM–6:30 PM, 8:30 PM–10:30 PM).
Default dropdown values should be implemented for show times.
Seat Selection:
After clicking "Next," users select seats based on the number of tickets chosen.
Reference booking.html  and booking.css  for the seat selection UI.
Checkout:
After seat selection, users click the "Checkout" button, navigating to the payment page.
Users select payment methods, enter payment details, and complete the transaction.
Post-Payment:
Upon successful payment:
Users are redirected back to the movies.jsp  page.
The selected seats are marked as unavailable for others to prevent conflicts.
Technical Implementation Details:
Frontend:
Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the booking and seat selection UI. Reference existing booking.html and booking.css files for the seat selection logic.
Implement responsive dropdowns and form validations for user inputs.
Backend:
Use JSP/Servlets or a similar backend technology to handle user requests and database interactions.
Create necessary routes:
/bookMovie to render the booking page.
/processBooking to handle form submissions.
/confirmSeats to save seat reservations.
Database:
Use the existing Already_created_table.db  database.
Design and utilize additional tables:
Booking table to store booking details 
ReservedSeats table to track unavailable seats for each show.
Update the ReservedSeats table dynamically after a booking is confirmed.
Seat Conflict Resolution:
Implement database locks or transactional isolation levels to prevent seat selection conflicts during simultaneous bookings.
Payment Integration:
Integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe).
Ensure proper error handling for failed payments and rollback of reserved seats.
